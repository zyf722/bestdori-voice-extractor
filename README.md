# bestdori-voice-extractor
This is a tool to generate voice datasets with labeled lines of characters from the game BanG Dream Girls Band Party. It is initially designed to work with [GPT-SOVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS).

The tool downloads voice and asset files from [Bestdori](https://bestdori.com/), and then generates a zip file containing the voice `.mp3` files along with a corresponding `.list` file.

## Usage
1. `poetry install` to install dependencies.
2. Change necessary settings in [bestdori_voice_extractor/config.py](bestdori_voice_extractor/config.py).
3. `poetry run python __main__.py` to run the program.

### `__main__.py`
The program contains 5 steps:
```py
# Step 1: Download assets
asset_downloader = AssetDownloader("assets")
asset_downloader.run()

# Step 2: Download voices
voice_downloader = VoiceDownloader("voices")
voice_downloader.run()

# Step 3: Analyze assets
asset_analyzer = AssetAnalyzer()
asset_analyzer.run("assets", "asset.json")

# Step 4: Analyze voices
voice_analyzer = VoiceAnalyzer()
voice_analyzer.run("voices", "voice.json")

# Step 5: Merge assets and voices
# Take MyGO!!!!! as an example
for i in range(36, 41):
    asset_merger = AssetMerger(str(i), "asset.json", "voice.json")
    asset_merger.merge()
```

- `AssetDownloader` will try to download all `.asset` files from Bestdori. These files are basically game scripts in JSON format.
- `VoiceDownloader` will try to download all `.mp3` voice files from Bestdori. **This might take a long time, as there are nearly 14 GB of voice files.**

Once you have all the assets and voices, you can use analyzers to generate `.json` files containing the information of assets and voices.

- `AssetAnalyzer` will analyze all local `.asset` files and generate a `.json` file as follows:
```json
{
    "2": [
        {
            "text": "こんなところに、喫茶店なんてあったんだね",
            "voice_file": "area0001-001"
        },
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

`"2"` is the character ID, and the list contains all the lines of the character. `"voice_file"` is the name of the voice file without the extension, which could be used to locate the voice file with the `.json` generated by `VoiceAnalyzer`.

- `VoiceAnalyzer` will analyze all local `.mp3` voice files and generate a `.json` file which is a dictionary with the voice file name as the key and a relative path to the voice file as the value:
```json
{
    "TalkSet1-1": "voices\\sound\\voice\\backstage\\talkset1-10\\TalkSet1-1.mp3",
    "TalkSet1-2": "voices\\sound\\voice\\backstage\\talkset1-10\\TalkSet1-2.mp3",
    ...
}
```

Finally, you can use `AssetMerger` to pack a `.zip` file of all the voice files from a certain character, along with a `.list` file containing the character ID, locale, and the text of the line:
```txt
<filename>|<chara-id>|<locale>|<text>
```

For example:
```txt
area5518-002.mp3|37|jp|どうしたの？　ポスターじっと見て
```

Pull requests are welcome.

### Planned Features
- As for now you have to download all voice files from Bestdori before specifying the character ID to merge. It would be nice to have a feature to **download voice files of a certain character only**.
